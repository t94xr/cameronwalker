    <h1>Web Hosting Dramas</h1>

<p>When most of us thinking of hosting our website, most of us wouldn’t have considered Google Cloud Platform as a viable choice - since we want cpanel, a manage platform - support and the ability to setup email and such.But in the days of gmail, the need of a domain hosted email address might not be so critical so having a domain and hosting - without the serious need of a IMAP/POP3 account for email makes life easier.I was in a situation, for myself I needed a good web hosting provider - cheap <em>(up to $5/mo)</em> and most importantly one that supported the new structure of <a href="//statamic.com">Statamic 3</a> requiring the ability to change the public_html/ folder to public_html/public/ … Something that I’ve found basically no standard … affordable web hosting provider does! <em>Even if you’re willing to pay up 10yrs hosting in advance!_So I was a situation, I had to host my website, but it had to be flexible to change the public_html folder to a subfolder _and</em> be affordable long term.So I went looking around, came to the conclusion that I was not going to make it happen, so I looked at VPS solutions - that were affordable.
But I preferably needed a email redirect setup - something easily done on cPanel, but does require some setup on Linux.So here I am looking for a low cost VPS or something similar.Then I take notice of <a href="//cloud.google.com">Google Cloud Platform</a> and then watching a youtube video, which gave me a good run down on how to use it and paired up with my exisitng Debian Linux server experience <em>(i have my own <a href="//server.cameronwalker.nz">linux server at home</a>)</em> I figured I was able to run my server on this … _maybe?_So there are some caveats;</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will need to have a credit card on the account.</li>
  <li>The server is slow, like 1vCPU and 614MB memory slow.
The idea is it’s a tiny webserver that will allow you to run simple static websites, small things - maybe a small php script or two - that kind of thing.Trust me, 614MB memory is NOT enough to install Statamic3 (after installing PHP7.x, Apache2, composer and such..) but it is enough to keep us within the <a href="//cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#free-tier">Free Tier</a> on Google Cloud.With the  f1-micro VM you have 30GB max storage, which does allow you to install a 3G /swapfile. Which does allow the system to use that as “RAM” when the RAM itself is used up (which installing Statamic 3 via composer can do easily.)So I have a f1-micro (1 vCPU, 614MB, 30GB) installed with Debian 10 x64 with a 3GB swapfile, which does allow Statamic3 to work - I’m even writing a <a href="//github.com/t94xr/gcp-statamic3">full installation script</a>.Its not entirely perfect, I can’t update within Statamic itself - using the Panel, I go into console and ssh in and write a script to take over the statamic3 installation, update it and hand it back to www-data.It’s a work in progress.</li>
</ul>
