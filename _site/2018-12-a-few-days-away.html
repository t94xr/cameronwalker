<p>So I took a trip to Nelson. Visited someone important to me, she had a nice new “prem” baby and I wanted to go visit - thus the story begins…After some organising, saving and some more planning - I found a couple of places to get Honey, which came led to a business idea for me to see if I can get off the ground, which would be a good idea. I visited a mate in Palmerston North, found a nice honey supplier which appears to have a great price and good honey - <a href="//downunderhoney.com">DownUnder Honey</a>.I carried on down and took the 3:30am InterIslander Ferry.Took a trip round the <a href="https://www.dangerousroads.org/australia-and-oceania/new-zealand/5828-queen-charlotte-drive.html">Queen Charlotte Sounds</a>, which was beautiful - cruizy drive, bendy, couple of good spots for fishing, swimming and laxing out in the sun.The drive to Nelson was … bendy, wow - the bendiest drive I’ve ever done.Got to see my friend with the new baby, he’s so adorable &amp; cute.So I arrived in Nelson, Friday lunchtime, had accomodation booked until Tuesday morning, left south to get some honey at <a href="//nelsonhoney.com/">Nelson Honey</a>, double backed up and went down around SH63 to Blenheim.Looked around, got a drink and visited a car meseum at the <a href="//www.omaka.org.nz/">Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre</a>, the aircraft side was really expensive, I couldn’t afford that. Admission was $15 - which was really affordable.Took a drive through Blenheim, took a few photos and then this happened;<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xWxUP18BpHc/XA-75z3-OLI/AAAAAAAAJ1Y/o-_MpenGUO8YGCBapIpiBCTHAMSxHPH2wCL0BGAYYCw/h1960/2018-12-11.jpg" alt="" />Got sideswiped by a Mainfreight truck - which stuck me in my car until I got some help from Bridgestone.</p>

<p>Called Mainfreight, let them know what happened and sent them photos and headed off to Picton, to get in line for the Ferry. Called my insurance and informed them.- Damaged front quater panel.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drivers side Indicator removed.</li>
  <li>Tyre wall cut/slashed (unsure of how bad).</li>
  <li>Bumber damage.I’m not quite sure what else is daamged. Might have to replace the front tyres, if I can’t get the same tyre again. but I’ll find out soon if it’s safe to drive to Taupo with, even if I limp home.Why is nothing easy!?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update</strong> - Later this day, as I was leaving Wellington, passing through &amp; entering Bulls, a stone hit my windscreen. So now I need a new Windscreen!</p>
