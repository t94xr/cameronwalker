<p>So I’m on my way home soon, well back to Taupo 😒</p>

<p>I had an excellent time, stayed mostly in a quiet area of Australia called <a href="//goo.gl/maps/XiCtnzHTv5doahPC9">Lobethal</a>, located east of  Adelaide itself - it was a great time. We took a road trip north to <a href="//goo.gl/maps/kJmoXHgDXghiuCtD8">Port Pirie</a> - where we stayed for a couple nights, where I did some sight seeing, doing not much online research beforehand; We did discover a hidden gem of the port - the <a href="//sacommunity.org/org/193975-RSL_Port_Pirie_%2526_Military_Museum">Port Pirie Military Museum</a>. This place is a functional RSA, which is great, but it has a real life Bell UH-1 Iroquois (nicknamed “Huey”).</p>

<p>I managed to collect a fair bit of video, I managed to record a fair bit of footage traveling through small towns in SA. So I plan to get that edited and uploaded when I can.</p>

<p>I spent time in <a href="//cityofadelaide.com.au/">Adelaide City</a>, shopping, sight seeing, taking trams and getting myself around and somewhat lost - it was fun. I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>On the last day in Australia, I decided to spend the time with a good friend of mine Tim, who I’ve wanted to visit for <em>years!!</em>
After a long overnight bus right from Adelaide to Melbourne, we spent the entire day together, I got to meet his partner, who is awesome❤️. We spent the day being tourists visiting the <a href="//oldmelbournegaol.com.au/">Old Melbourne Gaol</a>, The <a href="//melbourneskydeck.com.au/">Melbourne Skydeck</a>, while we had lunch at the <a href="//sandbarbeachcafe.au/">Sandbar Beach Cafe</a> <em>(btw totally loved the Beer Battered Barramundi fish &amp; chips! 😍, thats a definite must have!)</em>
Finishing off our day with a beer at the bar under the <a href="//goo.gl/maps/gYvvh7PWwmcyTg5y5">Evan Walker Bridge</a> and dinner at an Italian resturant just walking distance from his place before I got ready to fly out back to Auckland.</p>

<p>So here I am, now in Hamilton - getting ready in a day to pick up my father, drive back to Taupo and face real life again 😭
Back into emergency accomodation, searching for a new place to live 😒</p>
