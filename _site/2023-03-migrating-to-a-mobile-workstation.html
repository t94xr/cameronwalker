 While I was travelling, the <a href="//youtu.be/Cqa9hlRb1cc">Dell XPS 13 9310</a> was perfect, powerful, light, 4K OLED, 512G SSD, 11th Gen Core i7 tiny powerhouse! But now most of my ‚Äútravelling‚Äù has stopped for the most part now - but I‚Äôm still homeless and most likely looking to be for atleast a few months, until we can secure a new house to move into, I need something just a bit ‚Ä¶ bigger. Something just as powerful, with a graphics card, must have 4K and preferably 15 inches up!</p>

<p>So I was taking a look around and spotted a Dell Precision 5530 from <a href="//nzpcclearance.co.nz/">NZ PC Clearance</a>, then spotted the next version up, the 5540 edition. Still based off the XPS15 design but its more commercial professional counterpart.</p>

<h3>Dell Precision 5540 Mobile Workstation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ Processor i7-9750H, 6C/12T, 12M Cache, 2.60GHz up to 4.5GHz Turbo, 45W</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Video Card:</strong> Nvidia Quadro T1000 w/4GB GDDR5</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Display:</strong> 15.6‚Äù, UHD, 3840 x 2160(4K), IGZO, Touchscreen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Memory:</strong> 16GB, DDR4 2666MHz (upgradable to 64G)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Storage Drive:</strong> M.2 512GB PCIe NVMe Class 40 SSD</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I do love this XPS 13 - I‚Äôm definitely going to keep this unit! But I need to rock me some games and living out on this XPS13 is going to cause issues, it‚Äôs a great laptop to travel with, but for me - it‚Äôs not the workstation/desktop replacement that I need for the daily.</p>

<p>Now I opted for the <a href="//nzpcclearance.co.nz/product/dell-precision-5540-mobile-workstation/">5540</a> at $1,699, but you can get the <a href="//nzpcclearance.co.nz/product/dell-precision-5530-i7/">5530</a> which is a generation back with 8th Gen Intel, Pascal instead Turing-era Quadro for $300 cheaper at $1,399.
Now if you if you‚Äôre wondering why I didn‚Äôt get the <a href="//nzpcclearance.co.nz/product/dell-g15-gaming-laptop-5511-i5/">Dell G15 Gaming 5510</a> - two reasons, I don‚Äôt need a gaming laptop specifically for gaming - just enough to rock the games I want, but I‚Äôve also become a 4K display snob. üòÅ</p>

<p>So ignoring my desktop and 4K panel in storage, which have to wait until I get a house, I have;</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="//youtu.be/RAMERaW26nM">Dell Precision M3800</a> (Intel Core i7 4th Gen, 16G, 4K Touch), Fedora Linux</li>
  <li>HP Elite X2 1013 G3 (Intel Core i5 8th Gen, 8G, 2.5KTouch Tablet), Windows 11 Pro</li>
  <li>Dell XPS 13 9310 - (Core i7 11th Gen, 16G, 4K Touch), Windows 11 Pro</li>
</ul>

<p>I plan to get this 5540 upgraded with 2TB SSD &amp; 32G RAM.</p>
