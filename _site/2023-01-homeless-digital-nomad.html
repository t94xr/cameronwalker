<p>October me and my father were sent an email, informing us that the place we lived in for the last 8 years had been sold and we were given 90 days notice. So we started to look for another place to rent ‚Ä¶ within Taupo. ü§£ Which given the time of year and with so many applicants applying for housing within the region is well, not easy at the best of times - so we knew what was going to happen, we had a fairly good idea that we were not going to find another place to live within Taupo during November, December and January and probably February - so we planned to <em>for the most part</em> to be homeless, so we organised storage, which actually managed to fit roughly 95% of what we own, the rest managing to fit into half of a friends garage just nearby - who was willing to take care of it.</p>

<p>So just before we moved out, packed up, a friend of mine visited and he paid for my tickets to Adelaide, Australia for two weeks. ü•≥ <em>With me, booking a flight out of Melbourne, after booking a bus ticket overnight the night before to spend the day with a friend.</em> Which was really helpful and I got to visit this friend of mine for a day.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, Im going over to Australia for a trip, my father who‚Äôs 90 is also homeless - one would think hes stressed out and worried and being homeless is weighing him down, actually no - he‚Äôs fine - a bit stressed with moving and not being able to help as much as he wanted too, but he‚Äôs fine, he‚Äôs visitng a friend in Hamilton and other friends and family are going to visit over the couple of weeks Im overseas. And besides, not having bills to pay for a few weeks is going to help, which allows him to enjoy those two weeks all the better üòÅ so hes thinking postively - although he wants to get back into a house within maybe 2-3 months. He doesn‚Äôt expect to realistically, get back to Taupo after our holiday and find a house within a week given current housing situation.</p>

<p>So as I said my desktop is in storage üò≠ - its not exactly the kind of thing you can move into a motel/lodge kind of living situation, which does suck ballz - I have <em>migrated over to a</em> Dell XPS 13 9310 - its not the 2-in-1 model, its the 11th Gen Core i7 with the 4K touchscreen.</p>

<p>So now I‚Äôm using this Dell XPS, Ive decided Im going to learn After Effects.</p>
