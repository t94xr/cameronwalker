<h2>About</h2>


<p>With over 20 years of experience in Information Technology (IT), I’ve developed a diverse set of skills as a computer technician and IT professional. Based in Taupo, New Zealand, I specialize in Linux, server management, digital archiving, photo and negative film scanning, and home and business networking.</p>
