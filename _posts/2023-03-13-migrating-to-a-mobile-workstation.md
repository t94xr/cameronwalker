 While I was travelling, the [Dell XPS 13 9310](//youtu.be/Cqa9hlRb1cc) was perfect, powerful, light, 4K OLED, 512G SSD, 11th Gen Core i7 tiny powerhouse! But now most of my "travelling" has stopped for the most part now - but I'm still homeless and most likely looking to be for atleast a few months, until we can secure a new house to move into, I need something just a bit ... bigger. Something just as powerful, with a graphics card, must have 4K and preferably 15 inches up!
 
 So I was taking a look around and spotted a Dell Precision 5530 from [NZ PC Clearance](//nzpcclearance.co.nz/), then spotted the next version up, the 5540 edition. Still based off the XPS15 design but its more commercial professional counterpart.
 
 <h3>Dell Precision 5540 Mobile Workstation</h3>
 - **Processor:** Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ Processor i7-9750H, 6C/12T, 12M Cache, 2.60GHz up to 4.5GHz Turbo, 45W

- **Video Card:** Nvidia Quadro T1000 w/4GB GDDR5

- **Display:** 15.6‚Äù, UHD, 3840 x 2160(4K), IGZO, Touchscreen 

- **Memory:** 16GB, DDR4 2666MHz (upgradable to 64G)

- **Storage Drive:** M.2 512GB PCIe NVMe Class 40 SSD 

I do love this XPS 13 - I'm definitely going to keep this unit! But I need to rock me some games and living out on this XPS13 is going to cause issues, it's a great laptop to travel with, but for me - it's not the workstation/desktop replacement that I need for the daily.

Now I opted for the [5540](//nzpcclearance.co.nz/product/dell-precision-5540-mobile-workstation/) at $1,699, but you can get the [5530](//nzpcclearance.co.nz/product/dell-precision-5530-i7/) which is a generation back with 8th Gen Intel, Pascal instead Turing-era Quadro for $300 cheaper at $1,399.
Now if you if you're wondering why I didn't get the [Dell G15 Gaming 5510](//nzpcclearance.co.nz/product/dell-g15-gaming-laptop-5511-i5/) - two reasons, I don't need a gaming laptop specifically for gaming - just enough to rock the games I want, but I've also become a 4K display snob. üòÅ

So ignoring my desktop and 4K panel in storage, which have to wait until I get a house, I have;
- [Dell Precision M3800](//youtu.be/RAMERaW26nM) (Intel Core i7 4th Gen, 16G, 4K Touch), Fedora Linux
- HP Elite X2 1013 G3 (Intel Core i5 8th Gen, 8G, 2.5KTouch Tablet), Windows 11 Pro
- Dell XPS 13 9310 - (Core i7 11th Gen, 16G, 4K Touch), Windows 11 Pro

I plan to get this 5540 upgraded with 2TB SSD & 32G RAM.
