So I'm on my way home soon, well back to Taupo üòí

I had an excellent time, stayed mostly in a quiet area of Australia called [Lobethal](//goo.gl/maps/XiCtnzHTv5doahPC9), located east of  Adelaide itself - it was a great time. We took a road trip north to [Port Pirie](//goo.gl/maps/kJmoXHgDXghiuCtD8) - where we stayed for a couple nights, where I did some sight seeing, doing not much online research beforehand; We did discover a hidden gem of the port - the [Port Pirie Military Museum](//sacommunity.org/org/193975-RSL_Port_Pirie_%2526_Military_Museum). This place is a functional RSA, which is great, but it has a real life Bell UH-1 Iroquois (nicknamed "Huey").

I managed to collect a fair bit of video, I managed to record a fair bit of footage traveling through small towns in SA. So I plan to get that edited and uploaded when I can. 

I spent time in [Adelaide City](//cityofadelaide.com.au/), shopping, sight seeing, taking trams and getting myself around and somewhat lost - it was fun. I enjoyed it. 

On the last day in Australia, I decided to spend the time with a good friend of mine Tim, who I've wanted to visit for _years!!_
After a long overnight bus right from Adelaide to Melbourne, we spent the entire day together, I got to meet his partner, who is awesome‚ù§Ô∏è. We spent the day being tourists visiting the [Old Melbourne Gaol](//oldmelbournegaol.com.au/), The [Melbourne Skydeck](//melbourneskydeck.com.au/), while we had lunch at the [Sandbar Beach Cafe](//sandbarbeachcafe.au/) _(btw totally loved the Beer Battered Barramundi fish & chips! üòç, thats a definite must have!)_
Finishing off our day with a beer at the bar under the [Evan Walker Bridge](//goo.gl/maps/gYvvh7PWwmcyTg5y5) and dinner at an Italian resturant just walking distance from his place before I got ready to fly out back to Auckland.

So here I am, now in Hamilton - getting ready in a day to pick up my father, drive back to Taupo and face real life again üò≠
Back into emergency accomodation, searching for a new place to live üòí
