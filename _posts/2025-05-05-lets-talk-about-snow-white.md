So I watched *Hollywood Confidential*'s video on *Snow White*, [**Rachel Zegler DEMANDS South Park Episode Be BANNED After Getting Humiliated on TV!?**](https://youtu.be/LVJosjUNeNc), and it covers the situation quite comprehensively.

I totally agree. I'm 40 years old, and I remember having to sit through *Snow White* as a kid. Even back then, I understood the message it was sending to young girls: the kindness of the dwarfs, the hope of love, and the fantasy of being swept off your feet by a knight in shining armor—things that young girls often dream about.

The original animated movie was a success because it embraced fantasy. It told young girls it’s okay to dream about love, about magic, about being rescued—it was a fairytale, and that’s what made it so special and timeless.

This entire woke ideology is a toxic mess that Disney should have **never** let anywhere near such a core classic. *Snow White* helped build Disney into what it is today. The women who watched the original as little girls are now mothers—many with daughters of their own—who simply wanted to share a faithful modern remake of the film they grew up loving.

Rachel Zegler being such a "woke" figure should have been a huge red flag. But Disney, which South Park perfectly called out as a woke company, keeps allowing woke ideology to infect its movies, TV shows, and remakes—ruining them in the process.

Taking a movie that was meant to inspire young girls and turning it into a story where the lead character comes across as an entitled feminist who hates men is ridiculous. Joking in interviews that the prince’s scenes “could be cut” is not what fans of the original want to hear. The women who grew up watching *Snow White* didn’t fall in love with *Woke White* or *Feminist White*—they loved *Snow White*. What Disney delivered was definitely not *Snow White*, and certainly not a respectful modern remake of one of its foundational classics.

Disney needs to get rid of any and all woke ideology within the company. They should follow Marvel’s example and tell the employees who are pushing this stuff to leave[^1]. Disney should see the writing on the wall: embracing and encouraging woke ideology is not going to bring in audiences—especially not when the story you’re trying to sell is one that already exists and already worked.

From what I understand, *The Little Mermaid* was widely seen as a flop and a failure at the box office.

Sure, go ahead and create a new character. Make her Black and half-Asian, make her gay, build a new story, and call her a princess. But don’t take beloved, established classics and overwrite them with woke ideology. When Disney did a near frame-by-frame CGI remake of *The Lion King*—which from my understanding didn’t include any woke messaging—it worked. It was as if they fed the original film into an AI and re-rendered it with modern visuals. It proved that Disney can modernize its classics **without destroying them**[^2].
